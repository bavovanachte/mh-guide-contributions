# [Fort Rox](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Fort_Rox)

## Requirements:

* Ranks: Baron(ess)
* Map piece: [Fort Rox Battle Summons](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Maps_and_Keys#Fort_Rox_Battle_Summons)

## Summary:

## TL;DRs

  - Gather meteorite pieces during day to repair your wall and craft Cresent/Moon cheese
  - Defend your fort during nighttime, and gather resources for upgrading in the process
  - When you wall is destroyed (or you've retreated), use the resources to upgrade your camp
  - Repeat until you have enough upgrades to make it through the whole night (into dawn)
  - In Dawn, gather Dawn dust to buy traps and Sunrise cheese
  - Gather portal pieces by doing maps and use the portal to get to Heart of the meteor (need Sunrise cheese)
  - Buy the new Meteor Prison Core trap using Meteoric Core Fragment (dropped by Heart Of The Meteor).

## Recommended trap setup

Trap setups below assume you don't have any Limited Edition traps in your position. If you do, check CRE to see if
they perform better or worse than the ones mentioned below.

3 Power types are used in this area: Law, Arcane and Shadow. Once you make it till Dawn, the area provides a new trap
for each of these power types.

The choice of trap (type) depends on the phase you're hunting in. As for the base, make sure you have at least the
Aqua base in your possession. Anything better (Spellbook, Papyrus, Rift, ...) is a nice bonus.

### A - Day

If you've bothered finishing Claw Shot City, you'll have the S.L.A.C. II in your posession.
If you (like many other hunters) haven't, you have 2 main options:

  - Plain old S.L.A.C. When choosing a charm to boost the catchrate, power seems to be the way to go (check [CRE][CRE])
  - ACRONYM. Wrong power type, I know. Still, without charms it gives a slightly higher catchrate than S.L.A.C..
    Choice between the 2 depends on what charms you have available to you

Some numbers extracted from CRE (assuming Gouda, LGS, Aqua base and no charms):

  - S.L.A.C. II: 59.72%
  - S.L.A.C.: 40.39%
  - ACRONYM: 47.48%

### B - Night

First part of the night is Shadow, second part is Arcane.

- For Arcane, use your best setup. Assuming you haven't finished Living Garden, that would be ACRONYM.
- Same for Shadow. I'd recommend getting the Reaper's Perch first, but if your best is the Clockapult of Time
  (or something weaker), you might want to [check your catchrates][CRE] against ACRONYM
  (without charms, ACRONYM actually gets higher catch rates)

### C - Dawn

Use your best Arcane setup

## Cheeses and mouse pool

2 Cheeses you may have used before in your Lycan catching days are re-introduced here: [Moon](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Moon_Cheese) and [Crescent](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Crescent_Cheese) cheese.

Both are crafted/bought using meteorite pieces, but Moon requires additional 2 Magic Essence for 1 piece of cheese.
Check the wiki links for the exact formula.
Apart from these, store-bought and Super|brie+ work as well, but are not advised during the Night phase

  - **Day**: Use gouda (or Super|brie+ if you want to go a bit faster). Crescent and Moon work here as well, but
    [the numbers](https://mhhunthelper.agiletravels.com/loot.php?item=11&timefilter=all_time) don't show a major difference
    in drop rate.
  - **Night**: Use Crescent or Moon (the difference between the two is comparable to Gouda vs Super|brie+). Gouda and
    Super|brie+ will work as well, but they will attract the Battering Ram mouse, which does heavy damage to your wall
    (even if you catch him)
  - **Dawn**: Same as night, but with the added note that if you do have a limited supply of Moon (from events maybe?),
    you might want to consider using it here to optimize the amount of Dawn Dust you'll collect.

## Day phase: Collecting meteorite pieces

Day phase is where you start out. All mice here are law type and drop Meteorite Pieces, which you'll need for 2 reasons:

  - Crafting Crescent or Moon cheese
  - Repairing your wall.

You'll come back here often. The idea is that you gather Meteorite Pieces here, "spend" them during nighttime
(hunt with the in the form of cheese or watch mice destroy your wall) and then start the process all over.

As you start out, the first thing you'll have to do is get the first wall upgrade. It'll cost you 50 meteorite pieces,
which will go directly in your 50HP wall. Then, gather some more meteorite pieces to craft a batch of Crescent/Moon to
start off your first Night run. You don't need much (go with 20, why not) for the first run, as you'll retreat as soon
as you've gathered 1 Howlite to get the first Balista upgrade (this will significantly boost the awful catchrate you
get on the first run)

So, I've mentioned retreating. During the night phase you can retreat to day whenever you want, without losing the wall
HP you have left. When doing your first upgrades, you'll want to make use of this by retreating whenever you have enough
materials to get your next upgrades. The moment you make it past Pitch and you're collecting Bloodstones you might want
to consider finishing your run instead. More on that in the section on Night.

> There are a couple of alternative sources for Meteorite Pieces that may be useful, depending on your financial situation:
