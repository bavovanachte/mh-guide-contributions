# [Fort Rox](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Fort_Rox)

## Requirements:

* Ranks: Baron(ess)
* Map piece: [Fort Rox Battle Summons](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Maps_and_Keys#Fort_Rox_Battle_Summons)

## Summary:

Fort Rox is the area in Varmint valley following Fort Rox and Gnawnian Express Station, and keeps with the Wild West theme.
You're building and upgrading a fort by day in order to properly defend it against hordes of mice by night.

The area is really all about the fort upgrades. Even with better than average traps, you'll have some lousy catchrates
at the start, but you'll be able to boost them by upgrading your wall, cannon, moat,...

When you're done with the area, you'll have 3 new traps and a ticket to a new area: Queso Canyon.

## TL;DRs

  - Gather meteorite pieces during day to repair your wall and craft Cresent/Moon cheese
  - Defend your fort during nighttime, and gather resources for upgrading in the process
  - When you wall is destroyed (or you've retreated), use the resources to upgrade your camp
  - Repeat until you have enough upgrades to make it through the whole night (into dawn)
  - In Dawn, gather Dawn dust to buy traps and Sunrise cheese
  - Gather portal pieces by doing maps and use the portal to get to Heart of the meteor (need Sunrise cheese)
  - Buy the new Meteor Prison Core trap using Meteoric Core Fragment (dropped by Heart Of The Meteor).

## Recommended trap setup

Trap setups below assume you don't have any Limited Edition traps in your position. If you do, check CRE to see if
they perform better or worse than the ones mentioned below.

3 Power types are used in this area: Law, Arcane and Shadow. Once you make it till Dawn, the area provides a new trap
for each of these power types.

The choice of trap (type) depends on the phase you're hunting in. As for the base, make sure you have at least the
Aqua base in your possession. Anything better (Spellbook, Papyrus, Rift, ...) is a nice bonus.

**Day**

If you've bothered finishing Claw Shot City, you'll have the S.L.A.C. II in your posession.
If you (like many other hunters) haven't, you have 2 main options:

  - Plain old S.L.A.C. When choosing a charm to boost the catchrate, power seems to be the way to go (check [CRE][CRE])
  - ACRONYM. Wrong power type, I know. Still, without charms it gives a slightly higher catchrate than S.L.A.C..
    Choice between the 2 depends on what charms you have available to you

Some numbers extracted from CRE (assuming Gouda, LGS, Aqua base and no charms):

  - S.L.A.C. II: ~60% ( [CRE link][slac2-setup] )
  - S.L.A.C.: ~40% ( [CRE link][slac-setup])
  - ACRONYM: ~47% ( [CRE link][acronym-day-setup])

**Night**

First part of the night is Shadow, second part is Arcane.

- For Arcane, use your best setup. Assuming you haven't finished Living Garden, that would be ACRONYM.
- Same for Shadow. I'd recommend getting the Reaper's Perch first, but if your best is the Clockapult of Time
  (or something weaker), you might want to [check your catchrates][CRE] against ACRONYM
  (without charms, ACRONYM actually gets higher catch rates)

**Dawn**

Use your best Arcane setup

## Cheeses and mouse pool

2 Cheeses you may have used before in your Lycan catching days are re-introduced here: [Moon](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Moon_Cheese) and [Crescent](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Crescent_Cheese) cheese.

Both are crafted/bought using meteorite pieces, but Moon requires additional 2 Magic Essence for 1 piece of cheese.
Check the wiki links for the exact formula.
Apart from these, store-bought and Super|brie+ work as well, but are not advised during the Night phase

  - **Day**: Use gouda (or Super|brie+ if you want to go a bit faster). Crescent and Moon work here as well, but
    [the numbers](https://mhhunthelper.agiletravels.com/loot.php?item=11&timefilter=all_time) don't show a major difference
    in drop rate.
  - **Night**: Use Crescent or Moon (the difference between the two is comparable to Gouda vs Super|brie+). Gouda and
    Super|brie+ will work as well, but they will attract the Battering Ram mouse, which does heavy damage to your wall
    (even if you catch him)
  - **Dawn**: Same as night, but with the added note that if you do have a limited supply of Moon (from events maybe?),
    you might want to consider using it here to optimize the amount of Dawn Dust you'll collect.

## Day phase: Collecting meteorite pieces

Day phase is where you start out. All mice here are law type and drop Meteorite Pieces, which you'll need for 2 reasons:

  - Crafting Crescent or Moon cheese
  - Repairing your wall.

You'll come back here often. The idea is that you gather Meteorite Pieces here, "spend" them during nighttime
(hunt with the in the form of cheese or watch mice destroy your wall) and then start the process all over.

As you start out, the first thing you'll have to do is get the first wall upgrade. It'll cost you 50 meteorite pieces,
which will go directly in your 50HP wall. Then, gather some more meteorite pieces to craft a batch of Crescent/Moon to
start off your first Night run. You don't need much (go with 20, why not) for the first run, as you'll retreat as soon
as you've gathered 1 Howlite to get the first Balista upgrade (this will significantly boost the awful catchrate you
get on the first run).

## Night phase: Collecting howlite and bloodstone

Night is a dangerous time!  You need to hide behind the walls you’ve built, and hold out for 130 attacks (hunts) which progress at the top of the HUD. Succesful catches won't damage your wall. However:

 - Each FTC (without mouse stealing resources) will do 3 damage to your wall
 - Each FTC (with mouse stealing resources, red box) will do 5 damage to your wall
 - Each FTA will do 5 damage to your wall
 - Encountering the Battering Ram mouse will do 15 damage to your wall **regardless of whether you catch him or not**.
   Hunting with Crescent or Moon cheese will avoid attraction of this mouse altogether.

You're able to retreat back to the day phase at any time during the night without incurring additional damage to your
wall. If you don't retreat, assuming you don’t reach dawn, once your wall reaches 0 HP, you’ll pass out unconscious from
the assault and wake up back in the Day phase with a damaged wall. You'll need to gather Meteorite pieces to repair your
wall and enter the Night phase again.

What's the point, you ask? Well, the ultimate goal here is to make it through the night and reach Dawn. However, you
won't even get close during your first few runs. Instead you'll gather supplies (Howlite and Bloodstone) during Night,
which you spend on various upgrades to increase catch rate, increase wall HP limit, limit damage by mice,...
More on the different upgrades and their effect in the [upgrades section](#upgrades).
Each upgrade should allow you to make it a bit further into the night, until you finally make it till dawn.

In order to give you an idea on the drop rates of Howlite and Bloodstones, I constructed the following table containing
the drop rates **per catch** (assuming Crescent) per phase of Night. In order to get accurate numbers, you need to
multiply this number by your overall catchrate in that phase (check [CRE][CRE])

|                | Howlite | Bloodstone |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| Twilight       | 0.47    | 0          |
| Midnight       | 0.54    | 0.15       |
| Pitch          | 0.52    | 0.28       |
| Utter darkness | 0.42    | 0.43       |
| First Light    | 0.41    | 0.50       |

So, I've mentioned **retreating**. In the first few runs you'll be collecting Howlite, and won't make it past Pitch
(probably). In this case there is no "cost" to retreating: you don't lose additional HP, and Twilight, Midnight and Pitch
all roughly drop the same amount of Howlite so there is penalty of having to start back in Twilight. So during your Howlite
runs, retreat whenever you have enough resources to perform an upgrade.

As you advance further into the night, you might want to be more careful. At some point Bloodstones become an important
resource for your upgrades. As you can see in the table above the initial Night phases won't provide much Bloodstones,
so when you've made it past pitch you need to compare the ramp-up cost (the number of hunts and Crescent cheese needed
to make it through Twilight, Midnight and Pitch) against the benefits of coming back later with an additional upgrade.
Cannon-1 and Moat-2 are probably candidates for early retreat, as they don't require a lot of Bloodstones and you're
still losing a lot of HP in the later phases of night.

#### The mice

Except for a couple of exceptions, we can categorize each mouse encountered during Night into 2 groups:

 - Weremice: Encountered especially during the first part of the night (Twilight, Midnight, Pitch).
   Weakness to Shadow trap types.
 - Cosmic Critters: Encountered especially during the last part of the night (Pitch, Utter Darkness, First Light).
   Weakness to Arcane trap types.

Each of these follow the normal 3/5 damage rule for FTCs. As I said, there are exceptions:

- Battering Ram Mouse: 15 damage regardless of catch. Use Crescent or Moon to avoid him.
- Nightfire mouse: 10 damage on FTC. Only available during last part of the night. The **Energy Cannon** upgrade will
  guarantee a catch when encountering this mouse
- Nightmancer mouse: Extends night by 3 hunts on FTC (pushes the counter back 3 hunts).
  Only available during first part of the night. The **Sunsilver Ballista** upgrade will guarantee a catch when
  encountering this mouse

#### Stages of the night

Night is broken up into five stages, each with different mice of different power and damage to your wall, this mechanic we’ve seen before in the Iceberg.

|                | # hunts | Mice                                                  | Recommended trap |
|----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Twilight       | 35      | Mainly weremice and Nightmancer                       | Shadow           |
| Midnight       | 25      | Mainly weremice and Nightmancer. Some Cosmic Critters | Shadow           |
| Pitch          | 10      | ALL OF THEM!                                          | Arcane           |
| Utter Darkness | 25      | Mainly Cosmic Critters and Nightfire. Some Weremice   | Arcane           |
| First Light    | 35      | Mainly Cosmic Critters and Nightfire                  | Arcane           |

**Note on Pitch:**

This is a short phase, but Pitch can be a real... pitch (haha). Switching to Arcane means you're also more likely to
miss the Nightmancer (yes, he's still around), which can knock you back into the Midnight phase. Keep an eye on your
trap setup if this happens.

We haven't discussed Mana yet, but a small sneak peak: when activated, it boosts your hunt progression by 2 hunts per
hunt. If you want to boost past this area to avoid having being knocked back, you could choose to activate it here.

## Upgrades

When you've collected upgrade materials during night, you'll be able to use those to upgrade your fort equipment during
the day phase. In this section, I'll briefly explain what the different upgrades are. For a more detailed list, see
[the wiki][wiki-upgrades].

|           | Howlite |  Bloodstone |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Balista 1 | 1       | 0           |
| Balista 2 | 25      | 0           |
| Balista 3 | 100     | 20          |
| Cannon 1  | 20      | 5           |
| Cannon 2  | 30      | 15          |
| Cannon 3  | 50      | 60          |
| Moat 1    | 10      | 0           |
| Moat 2    | 35      | 2           |
| Moat 3    | 100     | 50          |
| Wall 1    | 0       | 0           |
| Wall 2    | 15      | 0           |
| Wall 3    | 40      | 20          |
| Wall 4    | 150     | 75          |

Generally, the first upgrades in a category require only (or mostly) Howlite, and as the upgrades become more powerful
they also require Bloodstones. This matches with the fact that Bloodstones are scarce during the first part of night and
become more abundant later on, so you'll have to push further into the night to get those good upgrades.

  - **Wall**: Each upgrade increases the maximum HP of your wall. It'll take more time to repair, but will allow you to
    push further into the night.
  - **Ballista**: Catch-rate boosts against weremice and Nightmancer (Sunsilver Ballista upgrade). These will make the
    first part of the Night (Twilight, Midnight, Pitch) easier, allowing you to push further into the night.
  - **Cannon**: Catch-rate boosts against Cosmic Critters and Nightfire (Energy Cannon upgrade). These will make the
    last part of the Night (Pitch, Utter Darkness, First light) easier, giving you that extra push to get to Dawn.
  - **Moat**: Decreases the amount of damage done to your wall, with reductions up to 3 damage (e.g. an FTA would only
    cause 2 damage iso 5).
  - **Mage Tower**: I'll go into a a bit more detail here, as the upgrades vary a lot. I still haven't discussed what
    Mana is, where you can get it and when you should use it, but I'll do it soon. Promise. What's important now is that
    The effects described here are only in effect when activating the Tower Mana through the HUD. The effects are pretty
    impressive, but Tower Mana is a finite resource so you won't have them all the time:

    - **Spotlight Enchantment**: Doubles loot drops of Meteorite Piece, Howlite, or Bloodstone.
    - **Power Enchantment**: Adds a chance to instantly capture any mouse.
    - **Healing Enchantment**: Heals your wall by 1 health after every hunt
    - **Sunsphere Enchantment**: Reduces hunts until dawn by 2 after every hunt

#### Which upgrades to prioritize?

First, let's get the Mage Tower out of the way. What you do with this one is entirely up to you. The upgrades aren't
very expensive in terms of Bloodstone/Howlite, but will cost Tower Mana. If you plan to boost your way through Fort Rox,
(and spend a lot of money on Tower Mana in the process) make sure to get these as soon as you can, as they are quite
powerful. If you're short on case, and have a limited supply of Mana, you might want to push it back on the priority
list.

Now, for the other ones.

In the first runs you'll only have access to Howlite, so that's easy: get Balista-1, Moat-1 and Wall-2 as the Adventure
book dictates. Note that at this point you can still retreat without delaying your progress. Hunt in Twilight/Midnight
and retreat as soon as you have the necessary Howlite. Upgrade and go again.

Next up would be  Cannon-1, Cannon-2, Moat-2 and Balista-2. I think the order in which you should do these depends on how easy
you can get to Utter Darkness at this point.
- If you're still only barely getting there, do something like Moat-2 --> Balista-2 --> Cannon-1 --> Cannon-2
- If you have a strong setup, do something like Cannon-1 --> Moat-2 --> Balista-2 --> Cannon-2

The rest if very subjective, depending on your setup and luck so far, and has been fuel for many debates. I assume that
by now you've made a few runs and have a clear idea on what you want to focus on. I'll just add a small note on
Cannon-3 vs Balista-3: if you've had some bad luck with Nightmancer, you've probably been eyeing the Balista-3 upgrade
for a while (the push back can be frustrating). I would caution constraint though, and prioritize Cannon-3 to get rid
of Nightfire instead. Being pushed back is annoying, yes, but has less impact on the amount of resources you'll gather
in your run.

## Dawn phase: Collecting Dawn dust

You’ll find three mice here : Monster of the Meteor, Night Guardian and Battering Ram (if not hunting with Moon/Crescent).
The damage mechanics stay the same at first, but each catch of the Monster will increase the damage of every mouse by
an extra 100%. You can find a table detailing the damage per rage level [in the wiki][dawn-damage] .

E.g. The first time you miss the Monster, the damage of both him and Night Guardian will go from 3 points to 6 points.
The next time, 9 points. Then 12. You get it.
If for some reason you're not hunting with Crescent or Moon: Battering Ram damage is not affected by this multiplier.

[Shielding charms][shielding-charm], if you have any, may be useful here as they prevent red boxes (FTC with mice stealing
supplies) which cause more damages. For reference: at rage level 10, a normal FTC causes 33 damage, a red box FTC does 50.

The Monster of the Meteor and Night Guardian mice drop Dawn Dust, which is used for 2 things:

  - Building the new traps: Droid Archmagus and Interdimensional Crossbow Trap. The parts needed to build these are
    obtained either as rare drops or by buying them in the General Store in exchange for Dawn Dust (you'll need 500
    dust per trap)
    A couple of drop rates (! per catch, multiply this by your overall catch rate):

    - Silver Bolt: 7.5 % with Crescent ([the data][bolt-drop-rate])
    - Animatronic Bird: 1% with Crescent ([the data][bird-drop-rate])
    - Dawn dust: roughly 3 dust per catch with Crescent ([the data][dust-drop-rate])

  - Craft Sunrise cheese to catch Heart of the Meteor (see next section). Costs you 25 Dawn Dust and 10 pieces will
    guarantee a catch.
  - Craft the portal projector to gain access to the Heart of the Meteor (100 dawn dust). See next section for more info

> Sounds grindy. How do I speed this up?
>
> - If you have the gold for it, you don't really need to gather any dawn dust.
>   Animatronic Bird, Silver Bolt and Sunrise cheese are all available on the Marketplace.
> - Baitkeep or Ultimate charms will allow you to reduce the amount of Sunrise cheese you need.
>   Not many hunters with the rank of Baron(ess) have any in their posession, though.
> - You might take your chances with less than 10 Sunrise cheese. 10 will guarantee a catch, but each Sunrise
>   hunt increases your chances of a successful catch. If you choose to go down this (risky) road, be prepared to buy
>   them on the Marketplace if it turns out you didn't get enough. Why? More info in the next chapter.

## Heart of the meteor: Getting the Meteor Prison Core trap

Hidden in the Dawn phase, is the "Heart of the meteor" bonus area. If you've finished Fiery Warpath yet, it will likely
remind you of the Artillery Commander bonus area.

It takes a bit of work to gain access to this area, and gather the cheese for it, but as a reward you get a shiny new
law trap: The Meteor Prison Core trap, which is upgradeable in a later area to the more powerful Ember Prison Core trap.

To gain access, you'll need to buy the [Fort Rox Portal Projector][portal-projector] from the Fort Rox Cartographer for

  - 100 Dawn Dust
  - 1 Fort Rox Portal Core
  - 1 Fort Rox Portal Console

We covered Dawn Dust in the previous section. The 2 portal parts are acquired by finishing (rare) Fort Rox Treasure Maps.
A [normal chest][normal-chest] will give you roughly a 12% chance of one of the portal parts dropping,
[rare chests][rare-chest] go up to 35%. If mapping confuses you, or you don't have friends to do them with, look below
the [section on maps](#more-on-maps)

When you reach Dawn, you can activate the Portal via the HUD. Note, the portal will be destroyed when it opens,
so it’s a one time use! Once you go in there’s no coming back without crafting another, so be sure to have your Sunrise
Cheese (25 dawn dust each, Cheese Shop) in your inventory and ready to go.

The Heart of the Meteor Mouse is weak to arcane traps, but pretty strong. Have no fear, though: after nine misses she
will collapse in exhaustion, and your tenth hunt is a certain catch.
Once you do catch her, you’ll be sent back to Daylight, and your hard earned Sunshine Cheese will automatically disarm.
She’ll also drop a Meteoric Core Fragment, which you can take to the Trapsmith to get the Meteor Prison Core trap.

If you have any Sunrise Cheese left, you can sell them on the Marketplace (they usually go for a pretty good price).

## More on maps

I strongly recommend doing maps in this area for a number of reasons:

- They provide a steady supply of Meteorite Pieces and Tower Mana. Not enough to get by on maps alone, but they give a
  nice boost
- They give a chance of dropping Portal parts to get to the Heart of the meteor. Aside from buying them on the Marketplace,
  maps are the only way of obtaining these.
- They don't require any special hunting strategies. Sometimes, maps will have some tricky mice that prevent you from
  advancing in the area. Not the case here: normal hunting should allow you to get all of the mice (especially if you're
  hunting in a team)

I would recommend starting maps as soon as possible to increase your odds of getting Portal parts. That may be a bit
tricky at first, as maps contain mice in all phases (Day, Night and Dawn). If you don't have friends to help you out,
you could check the [map groups][map-groups] to either leech a fort rox map, or find other hunters in that area
interested in doing maps together.

An interesting strategy for getting the Portal parts (you could sell them on the Marketplace) is to finish a Fort Rox
map by yourself (leave one easy mouse uncaught) and give away the 4 remaining hunter slots on your map but asking them
to send you back any Portal parts they may have received in exchange. This can be an interesting way of making some of
the money back you spent on Crescent cheese from the Marketplace, or optimize your chances of getting a Portal part in
case you don't have it yet.
