# [Fort Rox](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Fort_Rox)

## Requirements:

* Ranks: Baron(ess)
* Map piece: [Fort Rox Battle Summons](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Maps_and_Keys#Fort_Rox_Battle_Summons)

## Summary:

Fort Rox is the area in Varmint valley following Fort Rox and Gnawnian Express Station, and keeps with the Wild West theme.
You're building and upgrading a fort by day in order to properly defend it against hordes of mice by night.

The area is really all about the fort upgrades. Even with better than average traps, you'll have some lousy catchrates
at the start, but you'll be able to boost them by upgrading your wall, cannon, moat,...

When you're done with the area, you'll have 3 new traps and a ticket to a new area: Queso Canyon.

## TL;DRs

  - Gather meteorite pieces during day to repair your wall and craft Cresent/Moon cheese
  - Defend your fort during nighttime, and gather resources for upgrading in the process
  - When you wall is destroyed (or you've retreated), use the resources to upgrade your camp
  - Repeat until you have enough upgrades to make it through the whole night (into dawn)
  - In Dawn, gather Dawn dust to buy traps and Sunrise cheese
  - Gather portal pieces by doing maps and use the portal to get to Heart of the meteor (need Sunrise cheese)
  - Buy the new Meteor Prison Core trap using Meteoric Core Fragment (dropped by Heart Of The Meteor).

## Recommended trap setup

Trap setups below assume you don't have any Limited Edition traps in your position. If you do, check CRE to see if
they perform better or worse than the ones mentioned below.

3 Power types are used in this area: Law, Arcane and Shadow. Once you make it till Dawn, the area provides a new trap
for each of these power types.

The choice of trap (type) depends on the phase you're hunting in. As for the base, make sure you have at least the
Aqua base in your possession. Anything better (Spellbook, Papyrus, Rift, ...) is a nice bonus.

**Day**

If you've bothered finishing Claw Shot City, you'll have the S.L.A.C. II in your posession.
If you (like many other hunters) haven't, you have 2 main options:

  - Plain old S.L.A.C. When choosing a charm to boost the catchrate, power seems to be the way to go (check [CRE][CRE])
  - ACRONYM. Wrong power type, I know. Still, without charms it gives a slightly higher catchrate than S.L.A.C..
    Choice between the 2 depends on what charms you have available to you

Some numbers extracted from CRE (assuming Gouda, LGS, Aqua base and no charms):

  - S.L.A.C. II: 59.72%
  - S.L.A.C.: 40.39%
  - ACRONYM: 47.48%

**Night**

First part of the night is Shadow, second part is Arcane.

- For Arcane, use your best setup. Assuming you haven't finished Living Garden, that would be ACRONYM.
- Same for Shadow. I'd recommend getting the Reaper's Perch first, but if your best is the Clockapult of Time
  (or something weaker), you might want to [check your catchrates][CRE] against ACRONYM
  (without charms, ACRONYM actually gets higher catch rates)

**Dawn**

Use your best Arcane setup

## Cheeses and mouse pool

2 Cheeses you may have used before in your Lycan catching days are re-introduced here: [Moon](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Moon_Cheese) and [Crescent](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Crescent_Cheese) cheese.

Both are crafted/bought using meteorite pieces, but Moon requires additional 2 Magic Essence for 1 piece of cheese.
Check the wiki links for the exact formula.
Apart from these, store-bought and Super|brie+ work as well, but are not advised during the Night phase

  - **Day**: Use gouda (or Super|brie+ if you want to go a bit faster). Crescent and Moon work here as well, but
    [the numbers](https://mhhunthelper.agiletravels.com/loot.php?item=11&timefilter=all_time) don't show a major difference
    in drop rate.
  - **Night**: Use Crescent or Moon (the difference between the two is comparable to Gouda vs Super|brie+). Gouda and
    Super|brie+ will work as well, but they will attract the Battering Ram mouse, which does heavy damage to your wall
    (even if you catch him)
  - **Dawn**: Same as night, but with the added note that if you do have a limited supply of Moon (from events maybe?),
    you might want to consider using it here to optimize the amount of Dawn Dust you'll collect.

## Day phase: Collecting meteorite pieces

Day phase is where you start out. All mice here are law type and drop Meteorite Pieces, which you'll need for 2 reasons:

  - Crafting Crescent or Moon cheese
  - Repairing your wall.

You'll come back here often. The idea is that you gather Meteorite Pieces here, "spend" them during nighttime
(hunt with the in the form of cheese or watch mice destroy your wall) and then start the process all over.

As you start out, the first thing you'll have to do is get the first wall upgrade. It'll cost you 50 meteorite pieces,
which will go directly in your 50HP wall. Then, gather some more meteorite pieces to craft a batch of Crescent/Moon to
start off your first Night run. You don't need much (go with 20, why not) for the first run, as you'll retreat as soon
as you've gathered 1 Howlite to get the first Balista upgrade (this will significantly boost the awful catchrate you
get on the first run)

So, I've mentioned retreating. During the night phase you can retreat to day whenever you want, without losing the wall
HP you have left. When doing your first upgrades, you'll want to make use of this by retreating whenever you have enough
materials to get your next upgrades. The moment you make it past Pitch and you're collecting Bloodstones you might want
to consider finishing your run instead. More on that in the section on Night.

## Night phase: Collecting howlite and bloodstone

## Dawn phase: Collecting Dawn dust

Youâ€™ll find three mice here : Monster of the Meteor, Night Guardian and Battering Ram (if not hunting with Moon/Crescent).
The damage mechanics stay the same at first, but each catch of the Monster will increase the damage of every mouse by
an extra 100%. You can find a table detailing the damage per rage level [in the wiki][dawn-damage].

E.g. The first time you miss the Monster, the damage of both him and Night Guardian will go from 3 points to 6 points.
The next time, 9 points. Then 12. You get it.
If for some reason you're not hunting with Crescent or Moon: Battering Ram damage is not affected by this multiplier.

[Shielding charms][shielding-charm], if you have any, may be useful here as they prevent red boxes (FTC with mice stealing
supplies) which cause more damages. For reference: at rage level 10, a normal FTC causes 33 damage, a red box FTC does 50.

The Monster of the Meteor and Night Guardian mice drop Dawn Dust, which is used for 2 things:

  - Building the new traps: Droid Archmagus and Interdimensional Crossbow Trap. The parts needed to build these are
    obtained either as rare drops or by buying them in the General Store in exchange for Dawn Dust (you'll need 500
    dust per trap)
    A couple of drop rates (! per catch, multiply this by your overall catch rate):

    - Silver Bolt: 7.5 % with Crescent ([the data][bolt-drop-rate])
    - Animatronic Bird: 1% with Crescent ([the data][bird-drop-rate])
    - Dawn dust: roughly 3 dust per catch with Crescent ([the data][dust-drop-rate])

  - Craft Sunrise cheese to catch Heart of the Meteor (see next section). Costs you 25 Dawn Dust and 10 pieces will
    guarantee a catch.

> Sounds grindy. How do I speed this up?
>
> - If you have the gold for it, you don't really need to gather any dawn dust.
>   Animatronic Bird, Silver Bolt and Sunrise cheese are all available on the Marketplace.
> - Baitkeep or Ultimate charms will allow you to reduce the amount of Sunrise cheese you need.
>   Not many hunters with the rank of Baron(ess) have any in their posession, though.
> - You might take your chances with less than 10 Sunrise cheese. 10 will guarantee a catch, but each Sunrise
>   hunt increases your chances of a successful catch. If you choose to go down this (risky) road, be prepared to buy
>   them on the Marketplace if it turns out you didn't get enough. Why? More info in the next chapter.

## Heart of the meteor: Getting the Meteor Prison Core trap

## More on maps

I strongly recommend doing maps in this area for a number of reasons:

- They provide a steady supply of Meteorite Pieces and Tower Mana. Not enough to get by on maps alone, but they give a
  nice boost
- They give a chance of dropping Portal parts to get to the Heart of the meteor. Aside from buying them on the Marketplace,
  maps are the only way of obtaining these.
- They don't require any special hunting strategies. Sometimes, maps will have some tricky mice that prevent you from
  advancing in the area. Not the case here: normal hunting should allow you to get all of the mice (especially if you're
  hunting in a team)

I would recommend starting maps as soon as possible to increase your odds of getting Portal parts. That may be a bit
tricky at first, as maps contain mice in all phases (Day, Night and Dawn). If you don't have friends to help you out,
you could check the [map groups][map-groups] to either leech a fort rox map, or find other hunters in that area
interested in doing maps together.

An interesting strategy for getting the Portal parts (you could sell them on the Marketplace) is to finish a Fort Rox
map by yourself (leave one easy mouse uncaught) and give away the 4 remaining hunter slots on your map but asking them
to send you back any Portal parts they may have received in exchange. This can be an interesting way of making some of
the money back you spent on Crescent cheese from the Marketplace, or optimize your chances of getting a Portal part in
case you don't have it yet.
