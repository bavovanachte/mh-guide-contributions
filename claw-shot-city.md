# [Claw shot city](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Claw_Shot_City)

## Requirements:

* Ranks: Lord/Lady
* Map piece: [Calm Clearing Map Piece](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Maps_and_Keys#Calm_Clearing_Map_Piece)
* Law type trap (don’t worry, you can buy one here)

## Summary:

Claw Shot City is the first stop in a series of hunting areas following the “Wild West” theme.
It introduces a new power type: Law, used extensively in the areas that follow.

Hunting here allows you to unlock access to [Fort Rox](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Fort_Rox)

## TL;DRs

**TL;DR - 1** : You already have an (LE) law trap that’s better than S.L.A.C.

* Off you go. Gather 25 fool’s gold (maybe you have some from events already) and buy the Fort Rox Battle
  Summons to gain access to Fort Rox.

**TL;DR - 2**: I want to do it the way {devs, nature, god} intended it

* Buy S.L.A.C.
* Grind out the fool’s gold for S.L.A.C. II and maybe Claw Shot Base (see notes below).
  Law type traps are used in the following area(s) as well, and S.L.A.C.II provides a significant boost over S.L.A.C.
* Obtain Fort Rox Battle Summons for 25 fool’s gold to gain access to Fort Rox

**TL;DR - 3**: I’m in a hurry

* Buy S.L.A.C.
* Obtain Fort Rox Battle Summons for 25 fool’s gold to gain access to Fort Rox

  This means you won't have S.L.A.C. II to help you in Fort Rox. During the Fort Rox day phase, Law power type is also
  recommended. If you choose not to get S.L.A.C. II, it means you'll either be using normal S.L.A.C. or your best arcane
  trap. A common argument is that the decreased catch rate there doesn't really weigh up against the grind for
  S.L.A.C. II, especially if you can boost your catch rate using charms/auras. Additionally, if you can spare the gold,
  you can consider buying Moon/Crescent cheese to limit the Day phase to only gathering meteorite pieces for repairing
  your wall.

## Cheeses and mouse pool

No special cheeses are needed here. Store bought and Super|brie+ attract all mice.

Aside from boosting the overall attraction rate, Super|brie+ also increases the attraction rate of the Pyrite mouse
(from 0.56% using Brie/Gouda to 3% using Super|brie+, according to the CRE). Could be useful if you’re desperate for
fool’s gold, or you have the Pyrite mouse on one of your maps.

Additionally, the attraction rate of the Prospector mouse can be boosted using the
[Prospector's Charm](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Prospector%27s_Charm), available at the Charm Shoppe.

The mouse pool changes when you open a wanted poster, as some of the poster mice get added
(and the bounty hunter disappears). The attraction rates you find in the CRE are contradicting the mouse pool described
in the wiki, so if you’re looking for concrete attraction rates, you seem to be on your own.


## The trapsmith

There are 2 traps and 1 base to get here. If you have an LE law trap, you most likely don’t NEED any of these, and you
can skip over this section. For those who don’t:


* [S.L.A.C.](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/S.L.A.C.): Unless you’re buying your way out of this area
  (leeching maps, see below), you’ll need at least this trap. Mice here can only be caught using law type traps.
* [S.L.A.C. II](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/S.L.A.C._II): As the name suggests, this is an upgrade to the
  original weapon. As mentioned in the TL;DR section, you might want to skip the 500 fool’s gold grind  needed to get this
  trap and tough it out during Fort Rox (Day) using S.L.A.C. or an arcane trap
* [Claw Shot Base](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Claw_Shot_Base): This base gives your setup a +1000 power
  boost when coupled with S.L.A.C or S.L.A.C. II. That boost goes up to +2500 power if you couple it with a
  [Cactus](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Cactus_Charm) or
  [Super Cactus](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Super_Cactus_Charm) charm. The catch is that it’ll only
  provide this boost when used in Claw Shot City.

As for the Claw Shot Base, I don’t see any reason for buying it. Sure, it will boost your catch rate here, but the
moment you have enough fool’s gold to get the base, you’re already 75% to getting the S.L.A.C. II, so you might want to
get that instead and move on to Fort Rox, especially since it won't work there.
Next time you’re here, you’ll probably have a stronger Law trap anyway (and therefore no need for the base).

## Collecting fool’s gold

Even if you’re rushing the area, you’ll have to collect at least 25 fool’s gold in order to get the
Fort Rox Battle Summons for access to Fort Rox.


Asides from getting fool’s gold from events, there are 2 “reliable” ways of collecting it:


   * **Normal hunting**. Fool’s gold is dropped by the Pyrite and Prospector mice. SB+ should boost attraction of
     Pyrite mice and Prospector charms should do the same for Prospector mice (not clear exactly by what amount, so a
     more powerful charm might actually still provide a higher drop rate, depending on your initial setup)
   * **Wanted posters**. An undusted Bounty Reward will give you between 15 and 20 fool’s gold. The wanted posters are
     relatively short (especially if you have a deputy). More info on these in a section below

General consensus seems to be that doing wanted posters is a more reliable way of getting your fool’s gold. Of course,
the fool’s gold from normal hunting comes “for free”, the only thing to decide is whether to use Super|brie+ or not.
In order to get a general idea of how much fool's gold you'll gather by normal hunting, you can check the "Rate per catch"
for your cheese type from [Jack's Looter - Fool's gold](https://mhhunthelper.agiletravels.com/loot.php?item=57&timefilter=all_time)
and multiply that with your catch rate (check CRE). An example setup of S.L.A.C. + Aqua base (50% CR) would net you about 0.15
fools gold per hunt when hunting with Super|brie+ (taken over long periods of hunting: Pyrite and Prospector are relatively rare)

If want to rush the area and really can’t be bothered to do the maps yourself, you could always check one of the mapping
groups of facebook (or discord) to see if you can leech a wanted poster.
They usually go fairly cheap (for map leeching standards)

## Wanted posters

As mentioned above, you can earn fool’s gold by finishing Wanted Posters.
The mechanism behind this is similar to normal maps with a couple of differences:

   * Only 5 mice: 4 accomplices and 1 ringleader
   * You first need to catch the 4 accomplices before you get a shot at the ringleader
   * You can only take 1 other hunter along on this “map”
   * This “map” takes up a separate map slot: you can still do a normal or event map in parallel

Just like normal maps, these can be dusted in order to double the rewards (including the Fool’s gold).
Dusting these maps is generally not considered “worth it”, but by all means decide for yourself:

   * [Jack's Converter - Bounty reward](https://mhhunthelper.agiletravels.com/converter.php?item=1745)
   * [Jack's Converter - Rare Bounty reward](https://mhhunthelper.agiletravels.com/converter.php?item=1767)

Sealed wanted posters are dropped by the Bounty Hunter mouse. A
[Sheriff's Badge Charm](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Sheriff%27s_Badge_Charm) will guarantee the catch and
the poster drop, but won’t affect the attraction rate. These charms are a rare drop of the Bounty Hunter himself, but
also check the wiki link for alternative sources.

Note, you can only have one sealed wanted poster in your possession. The Bounty Hunter mouse won’t drop any if you
already have one.

When you open a poster, you get assigned randomly one of 6 types of posters (as described in the
[wiki](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Wanted_Poster))

## Adventure

The adventure is fairly self-explanatory. You need to finish one of each wanted poster type (there are 6).
The reward isn’t very exciting (some gold and some points).

As the type of wanted poster is chosen randomly when you open it, it could take some time to finish the adventure.
On the facebook mapping groups you’ll sometimes find people selling specific types of wanted posters, to help those
wanting to finish the adventure as soon as possible.

## Why you would come back

At some point, you’ll have moved past the area and you’ll have upgraded your law trap.
You’ll still gather fool’s gold, though (through events, by hunting mice for maps, …).
There are a couple of other things you can spend this currency on:

   * Crates: There are 5 crates available in the general store containing resources for areas ranked Lord/Lady or below.
     At the time of writing these are:

     * [Balack's Claw Crate](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Balack%27s_Claw_Crate)
     * [Furoma Claw Crate](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Furoma_Claw_Crate)
     * [Iceberg Claw Crate](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Iceberg_Claw_Crate)
     * [Tribal Claw Crate](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Tribal_Claw_Crate)
     * [Zugzwang's Claw Crate](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Zugzwang%27s_Claw_Crate)

     These can be a useful way of spending leftover fool’s gold to speed up progress in other areas or for mapping purposes

   * [Most Wanted Theme](https://mhwiki.hitgrab.com/wiki/index.php/Most_Wanted_Theme).
     It’s a theme and it’s expensive, so not something you’d likely buy when you’re first passing through the area.
   * Get the trap/base you skipped. As mentioned in one of the paragraphs above, you might have skipped S.L.A.C.(II)
     and the Claw Shot base. For collection purposes, you could come back to get that checkbox.
